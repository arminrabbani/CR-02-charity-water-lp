                <p class="story-desc">
                    charity: water was founded with a simple but powerful mission: to bring clean and safe drinking water to people in need. What began as a vision to solve one of the world’s most urgent crises has grown into a global movement powered by generosity, innovation, and hope.<br><br>
                    Since day one, we’ve believed that water changes everything. Access to clean water means better health, stronger communities, more time for education, and brighter futures. With every project funded, we see lives transformed—not by charity alone, but by dignity and opportunity.<br><br>
                    Together with supporters around the world, we’ve committed to transparency, showing exactly where donations go and sharing the real impact they create. Our story is still being written every day, with each well, pump, and community empowered by clean water. And we won’t stop until every single person on the planet has access to this basic human right.

            For women in Tanzania, collecting water can consume a significant portion of their day.<br> Mulitani, a mother of seven, used to make seven round trips to the river every day to get water for her family.<br> With a new clean water project in her community, that daily cycle of labor was broken, freeing up her time for other opportunities.
